Object, Array, RegExp, Date as well as primitives.\n\nPlease consider following this project's author, [Jon Schlinkert](https://github.com/jonschlinkert), and consider starring the project to show your :heart: and support.\n\n## Install\n\nInstall with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/):\n\n```sh\n$ npm install --save clone-deep\n```\n\n## Usage\n\n```js\nconst cloneDeep = require('clone-deep');\n\nlet obj = { a: 'b' };\nlet arr = [obj];\nlet copy = cloneDeep(arr);\nobj.c = 'd';\n\nconsole.log(copy);\n//=> [{ a: 'b' }]\n\nconsole.log(arr);\n//=> [{ a: 'b', c: 'd' }]\n```\n\n## Heads up!\n\nThe last argument specifies whether or not to clone instances (objects that are from a custom class or are not created by the `Object` constructor. This value may be `true` or the function use for cloning instances.\n\nWhen an `instanceClone` function is provided, it will be invoked to clone objects that are not \"plain\" objects (as defined by [isPlainObject](#isPlainObject)`isPlainObject`). If `instanceClone` is not specified, this library will not attempt to clone non-plain objects, and will simply copy the object reference.\n\n## Attribution\n\nInitially based on [mout's](https://github.com/mout/mout) implementation of deepClone.\n\n## About\n\n<details>\n<summary><strong>Contributing</strong></summary>\n\nPull requests and stars are always welcome.
