simple way to create a Node.JS Transform stream which processes in\nparallel. You can limit the concurrency (default is 16) and order is\n*not* preserved (so chunks/objects can end up in a different order to\nthe order they started in if the transform functions take different\namounts of time).\n\nBuilt using [through2](https://github.com/rvagg/through2) and has the\nsame API with the addition of a `maxConcurrency` option.\n\nNon-`objectMode` streams are supported for completeness but I'm not\nsure they'd be useful for anything.\n\nWritten by Thomas Parslow\n([almostobsolete.net](http://almostobsolete.net) and\n[tomparslow.co.uk](http://tomparslow.co.uk)) as part of Active Inbox\n([activeinboxhq.com](http://activeinboxhq.com/)).\n\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/almost/through2-concurrent.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/almost/through2-concurrent)\n\n\nInstall\n-------\n\n```bash\nnpm install --save through2-concurrent\n```\n\nExamples\n--------\n\nProcess lines from a CSV in paralel. The order the results end up in\nthe `all` variable is not deterministic.\n\n```javascript\nvar through2Concurrent = require('through2-concurrent');\n\nvar all = [];\n\nfs.createReadStream('data.csv')\n  .pipe(csv2())\n  .pipe(through2Concurrent.obj(\n    {maxConcurrency: 10},\n    function (chunk, enc, callback) {\n      var self = this;\n      someThingAsync(chunk, function (newChunk) {\n        self.push(newChunk);\n        callback();\n      });\n  }))\n  .on('data', function (data) {\n    all.push(data)\n  })\n  .on('end', function () {\n    doSomethingSpecial(all)\n  })\n```\n\n\nContributing\n------------\n\nFixed or improved stuff?
